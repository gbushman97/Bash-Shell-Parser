#BashShell Parser and AST Generator
#Directions for running the program:
The program takes input from a .sh file. To run the program just copy the path of the .sh file 
you want to use into the arguments of the program. To see the final AST you need to 
provide an argument of either -p to write it to a file name bckup.ast or -d to 
print the ast to the screen.
